DISCLAIMER! 
I don't make these files as my own files.

# JSON-WITH-ORDER
org.json has no orders when we put values, but I change it to be ordered by replacing hashmap to LinkedHashMap and combine all json classes to one jsonobject.java class to make it easy to use in anywhere
I don't know how to use licenses but use it for free anywhere but it's all classes created by org.json authors and edited HashMap to LinkedHashMap to be ordered by me.
